<h3>No component factory found for</h3>
<p>This error happens when you are trying to use a component, provider pipe or directive<br> that has not been imported and added to your ngModule. Whenever you add a new component,<br> provider, pipe or directive to your app, you must add it to the ngModule<br> in the src/app/app.module.ts file for Angular to be able to use it. To fix this error you can import<br> the offending component, provider, pipe or directive into the app.module<br> file and then if it is a provider add it to the providers array and for a component,<br>
     pipe or directive add it to both the declarations array and entryComponents array.</p>
